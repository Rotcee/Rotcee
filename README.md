### Hi there, I'm Héctor (aka Rotce) 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering & AI Student** with a strong focus on **Low-Level Security**, **Reverse Engineering**, and **Binary Exploitation**. I enjoy digging into how systems work at the hardware/assembly level. Sometimes CTF player

Currently learning on my own about low-level software exploitation and hardware.
