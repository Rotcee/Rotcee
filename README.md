### Hi there, I'm Héctor (aka Rotce) 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering & AI Student** with a strong focus on **Low-Level Security**, **Reverse Engineering**, and **Binary Exploitation**. I enjoy digging into how systems work at the hardware/assembly level and I am an occasional CTF player.

Currently, I am self-studying low-level software exploitation and hardware hacking.
